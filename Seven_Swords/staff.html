                <p>Eric Devin Tootell, Jr. Position: CEO/Founder</p><p> When he was little, Eric dreamed of creating something that people around the world would enjoy. There was rarely a time when he wasn’t drawing pictures and writing stories. Eventually, his dream took the shape of a business. He experimented with mediums to express his ideas, such as novels, comics, and even video games. In the end, none of these seemed to fit his vision. It was then that he watched an episode of Dragon Ball Z: Kai. The style captivated him and inspired his pursuit of an anime­like television series. Though he started out small, the young visionary constantly worked toward his goals and eventually gained the support of others to finish what he started. He is not only responsible for creating and helping run SSP; he also writes and edits any documents and creates concept art for many of the characters. He acts as the main producer of many of the commodities created by SSP and had a hand in shaping them into what they are. When he isn’t hard at work, Eric enjoys watching anime, playing video games, and hanging out with his friends..</p>

                <p>Hannah Elizabeth Newman Position: CEO/Co­Founder</p> <p> Back in 2014, Eric asked Hannah to become a member of his organization. While she thought it was a cool idea, she wasn’t really interested. Then, she watched Ouran Highschool Host Club; her first anime. The style and the unique stories these shows had to offer captivated Hannah and sparked a new passion within her. She wanted to help make something just as wonderful and officially joined the company. Since then, she has become the backbone of SSP. She keeps employees in check, helps Eric with managing the company, and even edits documents and colors when she can. Hannah hopes that one day, the shows she helps create will make anime (and shows of similar caliber) socially acceptable worldwide. She also wants to inspire others by showing that, through hard work and determination, you can make your dreams a reality. Most of all, she just wants people to be able to enjoy the products SSP creates as much as she does. Hannah loves to color, sing, listen to music, and play video games in her spare time.</p>
