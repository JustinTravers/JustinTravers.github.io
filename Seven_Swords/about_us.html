Seven Swords Production (SSP) is a company created by Eric Tootell, Jr. with the intent of 

making incredible animated series’. Utilizing the various talents of our artists, writers, musicians, 

and more, SSP has grown from a young boy’s dream to a flourishing organization with much 

potential.  We are currently working on creating a portfolio that will act as the foundation for our 

first project, Inseparable. Our goals project us finishing this by February of 2018, just in time to 

make an appearance at U­Con @ Uconn. 

Our company started with a young boys dream to make something that people around the world could enjoy. It wasn’t 

very clear to this young child at the time just what that something would be. As the years past there rarely was a time 

when he wasn't drawing pictures or writing stories. Eventually the child decided he wanted to make a business out of 

his art, but he did not know how to portray it. Then one day he watch an episode of Dragon Ball Z : Kai. The style of 

the show captivated him and he knew that this was how he wanted to portray his shows. Over the years his art style 

changed and improved. With help from friends along the way through middle school and high school things started to 

take off. He started a club at his High school and held Video game tournaments to try to raise money to get animation 

software. The tournament was a success but time ran out and the money was never used for its intended purpose. 

Before he knew it he had graduated from Stonington High school and was in the real world. At this point, the 

company consisted of seven core members and a few newer members. This is how our name was created.Through 

hard work and determination the company has reached where it is now. We balance our main jobs along with working 

on our shows. We plan to organise fundraisers like video game tournaments to try to raise money to trademark our 

name, and copyright our ideas. We are aiming at the moment to attend UCONN @ UCONN in February of 2018 to 

hopefully get our name out in the public eye.

Artaccess is an organization DESIGNED for the single purpose of creating the greatest anime known to mankind! It 

combines the various talents of artists, writers, technicians, musicians, actors and businessmen alike to achieve its 

goal! Eric Tootell leads his companions to victory as they journey on their grand mission!!!
